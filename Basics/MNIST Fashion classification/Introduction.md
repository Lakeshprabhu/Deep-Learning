ðŸ§¥ðŸ‘Ÿ Fashion-MNIST Classification using Deep Learning

This project implements a deep learning model to classify images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset, which contains grayscale images of 10 clothing categories such as T-shirts, shoes, bags, and coats. The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and trained to recognize fashion items with high accuracy.
